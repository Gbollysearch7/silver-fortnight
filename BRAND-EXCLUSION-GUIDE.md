## 🔍 Manual Spot-Check After Export

Even with exclusions, some branded keywords slip through. Look for:

### ❌ REMOVE THESE:
- "ftmo vs the5ers" (comparing competitors)
- "best ftmo alternative" (brand-focused)
- "is topstep legit" (brand review)
- "myforexfunds payout proof" (brand-specific)
- "how to pass ftmo challenge" (brand-specific process)

### ✅ KEEP THESE:
- "prop firm vs broker" (generic comparison)
- "best prop firm for beginners" (generic)
- "is prop trading legit" (generic)
- "funded trader payout proof requirements" (generic)
- "how to pass prop firm challenge" (generic process)

## 📈 Impact on Keyword Volume

### Expected Reduction by Tier:

| Tier | Before Exclusion | After Exclusion | Reduction |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Tier 0** | 1,000-1,500 keywords | 650-1,000 keywords | ~30-35% |
| **Tier 10** | 800-1,200 keywords | 550-850 keywords | ~30-35% |
| **Tier 20** | 500-800 keywords | 350-550 keywords | ~30-35% |
| **Tier 50** | 200-400 keywords | 140-280 keywords | ~30-35% |

**Don't worry!** This is GOOD. You're removing low-value branded keywords and keeping high-value generic ones.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **TradersYard Keywords = Separate List**
Don't exclude "tradersyard" or "traders yard"! These should be:
- Tracked separately
- Ranked for defensively
- Not part of Avalanche strategy (they're brand traffic)

### 2. **Competitor Comparison Keywords**
Keywords like "tradersyard vs ftmo" are tricky:
- They mention YOUR brand + competitor
- Keep if "tradersyard" is first
- Remove if competitor is first

### 3. **Generic Comparisons Are GOLD**
These are high-value:
- "prop firm vs broker"
- "funded account vs personal account"
- "challenge vs instant funding"
- "profit split comparison"

### 4. **Question Keywords = Best Tier 0**
Even if they mention brands in answers, questions are valuable:
- "what is prop firm challenge" ✅
- "how does funded trading work" ✅
- "why do prop firms have profit targets" ✅
